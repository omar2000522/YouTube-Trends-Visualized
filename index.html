                YouTube is the biggest video sharing platform in the world.
                It has over 2 billion users and over 500 hours of video are uploaded every minute.
                My goal is to visualize some of the data from the YouTube trending videos dataset.
                This dataset contains information about the top trending 200 videos on YouTube every day.
                The data is collected from 2017-11-14 to 2018-06-14.
                <br><br>
                Here we have a scatter plot but it is a bit off. 
                It shows the number of likes on the X-axis and dislikes on the Y-axis for each video.
                The color of the circle represents if the like ratio is positive or not (likes > dislikes).
                The lines connect the datapoints of the videos that appear in the trending page multiple times.
                Hovering over a datapoint shows information about the video, including the thumbnail!
                <br><br>
                You can see at the top there are 2-3 prominent lines sloping upwards in the scatter plot. 
                These represent controversial videos that garnered many likes but also many dislikes.
                One of the videos turned from green to red, indicating that it was trending for a negative reason.
                Hover over it to see what it is!

                This is a line graph that simply shows us the growth of the YouTube trending videos over time.
                You can see that the number of views/likes/comments is gradually increasing over time and taking off after March of 2018.

            <div class="tx">
                This is a stacked streamgraph that shows the distribution of the trending videos by category.
                The categories are sorted by the number of historical total views.
                <br><br>
                This visualization makes it easy to see that 
                a huge majority of the trending videos views are from the Music category.
                The Entertainment category is the second most popular. 
                An interesting note is that the Music category 
                videos became disproportionately more popular over time compared to other categories.

        <div id="vis4" class="visualization">
            <div class="tx">
                This is a map of the world that shows the average views of a trending video by region.
                The regions are the ones available in the dataset.
                <br><br>
                interestingly, the regions with the highest average views are not the most populated regions.
                The highest average views are in Great Britain despite the fact that its population is 1/6th the size of the United States.
                My guess is that trending videos in Great Britain are more popular than trending videos in the United States.
                Not necessarily meaning UK videos are more popular, but that the UK trending page is more popular.

            <div class="tx">
                This is a boxplot that shows the distribution of the number of comments on trending videos by category.
                Here we find another interesting finding. 
                Despite the fact that the Gaming category is not in the top 5 most viewed categories, 
                the Gaming category has the most median comments.
                <br><br>
                This could be because the Gaming category is more interactive than other categories.
                It could also be because the Gaming category is more popular with younger audiences,
                who tend to comment more than older audiences.
